## Getting started

### Requirements
##### Requires Android Studio
[Android Studio Download Page](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

### Clone and Sync
```
$ git clone https://github.com/hhroc/yellr-android.git
$ cd yellr-android
$ gradle sync
```
**(if running Android Studio on Mac, it`s a good idea to use Android Studio to import the project which will prompt to build and sync gradle. This is because when you try to run gradle sync on Mac from the terminal, you might run into weird issues - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19292526/problems-with-apply-android-plugin) 

### Server

Note: the current code points to a demo URL at mycodespace.net.  You may want to run your own server for development.  You can do that by heading over to [yellr-server](http://github.com/hhroc/yellr-server) and running it there.
